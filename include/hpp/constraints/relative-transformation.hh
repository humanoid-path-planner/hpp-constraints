    /** Relative transformation of two fixed frames in robot joints

        The value of the function is a 6-dimensional vector. The 3 first
        coordinates are the position of the center of the second frame expressed
        in the first frame. The 3 last coordinates are the log of the
        orientation of frame 2 in frame 1.

        \f{equation*}
	f (\mathbf{q}) = \left(\begin{array}{c}
	\mathbf{translation}\left(T_{1/J_1}^T T_1^T T_2 T_{2/J_2}\right)\\
	\log ((R_1 R_{1/J_1})^T R_2 R_{2/J_2}) \end{array}\right)
        \f}

	The Jacobian is given by

	\f{equation*}
	\left(\begin{array}{c}
	(R_1 R_{1/J_1})^T (\left[R_2 t_{2/J_2} + t_2 - t_1\right]_{\times}
	J_{1\,\omega} - \left[R_2 t_{2/J_2}\right]_{\times} J_{2\,\omega} +
	J_{2\,\mathbf{v}} - J_{1\,\mathbf{v}}) \\
	J_{log}((R_1 R_{1/J_1})^T R_2 R_{2/J_2})(R_1 R_{1/J_1})^T
	(J_{2\,\omega} - J_{1\,\omega})
